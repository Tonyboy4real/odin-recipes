    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 small aubergine, cut into roughly in dice</li>
        <li>1 medium courgette, cut into roughly in dice</li>
        <li>250g small chestnut mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>100g dried red split lentils</li>
        <li>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar, any kind</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="recipe-method__list"><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. </p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Heat the olive oil in a large, non-stick saucepan and fry the onion for 3–4 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned, stirring. Add the aubergine, courgette, pepper and mushrooms and fry for 12 minutes, stirring regularly.</p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Add the garlic and cook for a few seconds more, then stir in the red lentils, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, sugar and crumbled stock cube. </p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Refill one of the tomato tins with water (400ml/14fl oz) and pour into the pan. Stir well, bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the spinach leaves, a handful at a time and cook for 1–2 minutes more. </p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">While the vegetables are simmering, make the white sauce. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. When it is hot add the flour and cook, stirring all the time, for 1 minute. Stir in the milk, yeast, bay leaf and nutmeg and season well with salt and pepper. </p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly with a metal whisk over a moderate heat for 4–5 minutes, or until smooth and thickened. (Use a silicone covered whisk if using a non-stick saucepan.) Adjust the seasoning to taste – you’ll need more black pepper than you might imagine.</p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Spread a third of the vegetable mixture over the base of a 2½ –3  litre/4½– 5 pints ovenproof lasagne dish and cover with a single layer of lasagne sheets. Top with another third of the vegetable mixture (don’t worry if it doesn’t cover evenly) and a second layer of lasagne. </p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Pour over just under half of the white sauce, after removing the bay leaf, and very gently top with the remaining vegetable mixture. Finish with a final layer of lasagne and the rest of the white sauce. </p></li><li class="recipe-method__list-item"><p class="recipe-method__list-item-text">Bake for 35–40 minutes, or the pasta has softened and the topping is nicely browned and bubbling. Stand for 5 minutes before cutting to allow the filling to settle.</p></li></ol>
